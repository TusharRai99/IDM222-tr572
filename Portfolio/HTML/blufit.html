        <h2>A way to improve student health by preventing them from excess screen exposure and providing healthy alternatives.</h2>
    </header>

    <main>
<div class="wrapper">
<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic and online classes, we noticed that students are stuck at home in their seats staring at screens for hours at a time.  And it’s not just our own devices that we have to consider, nowadays screens are everywhere. We realized that this can cause a multitude of health problems, as this lockdown and online classes continues, and this led us to our research question:</p>
<p class="bold">How can we improve student’s physical health when they are on computers for classes throughout the day?</p>

<h2>Research Findings</h2>
<p>We started off our research with user research to establish our understanding of our users, and the problems they have. We each conducted a user interview (a total of 4 people) and also did a user survey, in which we got a total of 38 responses. We analyzed and synthesized our research results through affinity mapping and found a list of major issues/findings:

    Our user interview primarily focused on the physical health aspect and the effects on physical health from a sedentary lifestyle. The research findings that we received were more or less parallel to our expectations: the effects on physical health as a result of the pandemic and quarantine were not too good. In terms of our user survey that we conducted, we asked people to explain experiences in which their mental health and general well-being were impacted by the pandemic.</p>

    <h3>Lack of Motivation:</h3>
    <p>For our first major finding of an issue, it was a lack of motivation in people’s studies, work, and general daily activities. The lockdown as a result of the pandemic has had serious effects on people’s mental health as they were limited to little to no human interaction. We also found that the accumulated uncertainties thus stress have resulted in people losing optimism and turning back to the ‘covid fatigue’ where negative and angry reactions trump people’s wants to stay productive.</p>

    <h3>Digital Eye Strain:</h3>
    <p>Our next finding was digital eye strain. It wasn’t  a surprise that people are constantly on their devices for school, work, and other commitments as the lockdown prevent people from meeting in person in public spaces. It seems that everyone is living a virtual life at this point and is constantly staring at their screens for hours on end. This results in negative effects on the eyes and head in general. As written here, one person mentioned that their ‘eyes have been so dry the past couple of days and another person noted they ‘got headaches from staring at the screen for too long and also got eye fatigue.’ Further research helped us to find the 20-20-20 rule:  every 20 minutes spent using a screen, the user should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from them for a total of 20 seconds. This rule was definitely something our team kept in the back of our heads as it would essentially help to reduce eye strain and different related symptoms from looking at the screen for too long.</p>

    <h3>Physical Impact:</h3>
    <p>The previous issue transitions well into the next issue which is overall physical pain as a result of a sedentary habit and lack of movement. It is without a doubt that many people have turned to a virtual life without a choice, which results in physical pain. From our user research findings, many people seemed to have experienced back pains, neck and shoulder pains, and tension and are in need of constant stretching and doing activities. From the user interview, one person mentioned that they had pain in their lower back’ and it was no better as they had ‘stiff shoulders.’ Another person said that they’ve ‘been bending their neck too much looking down’ and ’have developed a hunch.’ To combat this, our team researched ways to keep users from further developing physical pain. We came across an article outlining the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle as it may lead to long-term health problems. (One to note is thrombosis which is potentially fatal blood clots that form in the veins of the legs.)</p>

    <h3>Disruptive Sleeping Pattern: </h3>
    <p>The fourth and final major finding was disruptive sleeping patterns. The user research survey showed that many people had difficulty sleeping and some have developed sleeping disorders. Research showed us that the main factor of this effect was blue-light exposure from long hours of screen time. Blue light is a color in the visible light spectrum that can be seen by human eyes. Blue light is a short wavelength, which means it produces higher amounts of energy. This means that though it may be beneficial for people to be exposed to blue-light during the day as it provides them with alertness and attentiveness, it can be detrimental to their health if they are exposed to blue light during the night time. This is because blue-light exposure during the night time can lead to disrupted circadian rhythms, which are the human body’s biological clock. Blue light suppresses melatonin which makes it difficult for people to fall asleep. From all this, we concluded that it was important to have in mind that long-hours of screen time, thus long hours of blue light exposure, should somehow be prevented.

    </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Our main goal is that we aim to get students out of their sedentary lifestyle by providing a solution that encourages them to do activities, and promotes a healthier relationship with the screens in their lives.</p>

    <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
    <p>So now that we know our problem and what the goal is, as part of our ideation stage,  we did competitive research to study other apps that also focus on improving productivity and wellbeing. We studied how those app function, and what’s unique about them, what can we learn, what should we avoid.</p>

    <h3>Forrest App</h3>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/forrest app.jpg" alt="Forrest App">
    <ul>
        <li>Helps you focus by setting how long you want to not use your phone for, and through the duration of that time, you can grow a tree as well.</li>
        <li>Like: Functionality – Reminder appears on other apps to remind you to not be distracted, causes you to kill your plant if you want to continue using your app.</li>
        <li>Smart and effective move to make users stick to their goal of not using their phone</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>BoosterBuddy</h3>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/booster buddy.jpg" alt="BoosterBuddy">
    <ul>
        <li>What’s unique about BoosterBuddy is that you have actually had a virtual friend, who encourages you, and you can only interact with him (wake him up) after completing three daily tasks.</li>
        <li>The use of having a “friend” was attractive to us, because it can help in increasing motivation for users rather than just telling them what to do informatively. </li>
        <li>This struck an idea for us to think about using friends as a source of motivator – but we will get into this later.</li>
        <li>Downside: a virtual friend isn’t the best way to be connected at a deeper level</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Breethe App</h3>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/breethe app.jpg" alt="Breethe App">
    <ul>
        <li>Meditation sort of app</li>
        <li>It’s a very breathable UI, dark relaxing colors</li>
        <li>Reflects their concept of bringing inner peace and having a tranquil environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation Stage 1</h2>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/Ideation Stage 1.jpg" alt="Ideation Stage 1">
    <p>We had four main  how-might-we questions that guided our ideation process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>How might we encourage users to stop looking at their screen and get out of their sedentary positions?</li>
        <li>How might we make users stick to the one hour downtime? </li>
        <li>How might we increase user’s motivation to take on physical activities? </li>
        <li> How might we inform users of staring at blue-light screens for a long time?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Wrist Watch:</h3>
    <p>Initially, many of our sketches were geared towards the idea of fitness tracking watches. This is one of our sketches of a watch. Because of the similarity in design as some of the competitors like Apple and Fitbit, our team decided to steer away from the direction of creating a watch that has a different and unique functionality feature. What our team did agree upon after this part of our ideation process was to develop a wearable product that would record and sync information into a mobile app</p>

    <h3>Potential UI:</h3>
    <p>The next two sketches were of potential user interface designs. The first design shows different screens where users could see the time spent on their screens versus the time spent exercising or being active. Other parts show a pedometer where a user could see how much of their daily goal they’ve completed in terms of how much they’ve walked. The upper right screen shows the different heart rates over a course of a day and the bottom right screen shows a GPS tracking feature that the wearable device could record and sync onto the device. The next sketch shows a potential notification on the lock screen as well as another screen showing the number of steps taken by the user.</p>

    <h3>Notifications/Motivation: </h3>
    <p>The last sketch here shows a cute image as a method of motivating users to get out of their sedentary habits and be more active. The idea is that the user would walk to earn coins and customize their own little pet, similar to BoosterBuddy.</p>


    <h2>Ideation Stage 2</h2>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/Ideation Stage 2.jpg" alt="Ideation Stage 2">

    <p>Trying to find answers to all the questions we were asked and looking at survey results we realized to help people we need a human element in our app that would make it interesting to them during quarantine where everyone misses human connection . The social element we found was the concept of Accountability Partners.</p>

    <h3>Accountabilty Partner</h3>
    <p>We found with research that A person is more likely to do a thing if someone keeps them accountable for it. We had a bunch of questions on how we might….. And we thought we could fix these problems by adding a social element of accountability partners. An accountability partner can be a friend or group of friends who keep each other accountable for all the good habits and actions that keep us mentally and physically well. The App also shows data that tells how much screen exposure you had and if you have been meeting your goals for reduced exposure time which is substituted by wellness activities</p>

    <h3>Lockscreen/Downtime:</h3>
    <p>From our sketches, our team also gravitated towards this idea of locking user’s screens so that it would prevent them from more screen time, or rather to have them be more active during the times they won’t be on the screen.</p>

    <h2>Ideas for the Physical Product</h2>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/Glass Sketch 1.jpg" alt="Glass Sketch1">
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/Glass Sketch 2.jpg" alt="Glass Sketch2">
    <h3>Glasses Sketches:</h3>
    <p>We found that we needed a way to help our users regulate their screen time so that they could focus on other activities that can help them take care of their physical health so how we came up with  The idea of blue light sunglasses with an inbuilt blue light meter. These glasses can be worn while using screens and data will be sent from the glasses to the app which then helps you take a break and take yourself when necessary.</p>

    <h3>Charging:</h3>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/Chargin Dock.jpg" alt="Charging Dock">
    <p>We initially went for USB type C but it would be hard to plug in every time so went for the portable charging dock that you can also use as a case.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/The Physical Product.jpg" alt="Solution">
    <p>Our solution statement is as follows:  For university students who are unmotivated and live a sedentary lifestyle, BluFit’s blue-light filter glasses measure user’s screen exposure and sends reminder notifications to help reduce digital eye strain and encourage physical activities.</p>

    <h2>The Product</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sleek and light design, with an inbuilt blue light meter.</li>
        <li>It covers full vision span and comes with a portable charging  dock.</li>
        <li>It comes at different prices.</li>
        <li>The blue light meter sends the data to the phone which can use the data in a variety of different ways. For example, Too much exposure to blue light at night is most harmful as it makes it difficult to sleep and therefore disrupt your sleep cycle, which is why we have the 1-hour downtime feature included too so when it’s an hour before the user’s bedtime, he is given a notification/reminder telling him he should stop using the phone.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>The BluFit App</h2>
    <img src="/Portfolio/XImages/BluFit App/The app.jpg" alt="BluFit App">
    <p>First look at our UI, we tried to come up with a very calm color scheme, with very gentle gradients. You can also see that our boxes are slightly transparent, really going for that tranquil vibe with a very breathable design.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Motivational message that changes daily – to get you started with a more positive mindset.</li>
      <li>Screen exposure time – made sure that the screentime is one of the first things you see and quickest to access by putting it at the center.</li>
      <li>list of suggested activities you can do during your break which
        help you be more active, relax, and destress. 
        Sleep is not necessarily an activity, but this is where you can put your bedtime so one hour before your bedtime, it reminds you to put your phone away so you can sleep better. This is in response to our blue light findings where being exposed to blue lights before sleeping can make it difficult to sleep and thus leads to an inconsistent sleep cycle.</li>  
        <li>“More Info”  – the glasses receive the amount of screen exposure you get and this data displayed as a graph as a visual tool to help make users aware of how much time is actually being spent staring at screens, and how much less or more compared to previous days</li>

        <li>Below you can set how often you want to be reminded to take an eye break. When you click on it you can see that there is a message recommending you to do 20minutes because it is actually recommended by optometrists to look away from your screen every 20minutes. There’s actually a 20-20-20 rule.</li>

        <li>We also have a challenge page where you can set goals together with your friends. You can do different challenges and set goals and for when they should end. And also see your friend’s progress and sort of keep each other accountable. This idea is based on a research study where doing physical activities with your friends rather than alone can motivate one another to do the task more. In this research, they found that young people cycled a longer distance when they were with peers in comparison to alone. </li>

    </ul>
    <p>With this research in mind, we believe that this idea can help aid in user motivation, especially during hard times like right now in the pandemic.</p>

    <h2>BluFit Final Storyboard</h2>
