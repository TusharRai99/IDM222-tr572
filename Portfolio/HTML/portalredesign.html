<h2>Overview & Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The website is Drexel University’s Payment Portal. It is used by prospective/current students and parents to pay bills/charges/ or get electronic refunds with multiple options to do so. The current state of the website is functional but it is confusing and takes more time to understand and proceed than it should. The goal of the website is to make it a platform where parents and students can easily pay bills/tuition or other payments related to college.</p>

<h2>Users and Audience</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prospective and Current Students</li>
    <li>Parents of Prospective and Current Students</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scope and Constraints</h2>
<p>The only constraint I felt was the need to keep the redesign consistent with the current theme of Drexel’s Website.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<h3>Usability Test & Think-aloud Interview</h3>
<p>I started out by doing a usability test of the website. I interviewed three of my friends who use or have used the Drexel’s Payment system in the past. I basically conducted an hour-long semi-structured Think-out loud interview with them where I asked them about certain tasks on the portal and asked follow-up questions about the process.</p>

<h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>

<p>
    After I conducted the interview. I noted down any quotes, sayings, insights, or other details I noticed from the interview and created an affinity diagram to find the most important problems.
</p>

<h3>Understanding the Website, Strength, Weaknesses, and Goals</h3>
<p>After the interview, I made a list of all the strengths, weaknesses, and goals for the redesign of the website</p>
<h4>STRENGTHS</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Easy to navigate​</li>
    <li>Minimalistic Design​</li>
    <li>Good Use of Color Schemes​</li>
    <li>Use of easily visible information/fonts​</li>
    <li>Good Use of Security feature; Automatic Logout</li>
</ol>

<h4>WEAKNESSES</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Inconsistent Design of the Menu Bar; some are drop-down, some are not!​</li>
    <li>Little to no difference in content between some pages, though named differently; Account Activity and Statements provide the same information in different formats​.</li>
    <li>Same pages are labeled differently under different sections of the menu bar; The refund section is named as “Refunds” on the menu bar, it can also be found under the ‘My Profile’ Section with a different name “Electronic Refunds”​</li>
    <li>A lot of sections give little to no information about what they are for unless you go through them</li>
    <li>There is no hierarchy in the arrangement of objects in the main bar, there is no categorization of similar information​</li>
</ol>

<h4>IMMEDIATE GOALS </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Rearrange the information architecture and put similar pages under a similar category​</li>
    <li>Use of Consistent functional design for the Main Bar​ (All elements in the menu bar behave the same way and are of a similar order of importance, if one is a drop-down object then all should be drop-downs.)</li>
    <li>Removing multiple ways to access the same section(keeping the importance of consistency in mind.</li>
    <li>Using an information pop up that shows up when you hover your pointer over a certain section/option​</li>
    <li>Redesign of the My Account section of the main bar, removing multiple pages which show the same information and replacing them with just one page​</li>
</ol>

<h3>Card Sorting Excercise</h3>
<img src="/Portfolio/XImages/Drexel Portal Redsign/CardSort.jpg" alt="Card Sorting Excercises">
<p>To simplify the information architecture of the website and redesign it in a way that the user understands, I decided to do a card sorting exercise with my friends who used/have used the Drexel Payment portal.

    Above are the results of the 3 card sorts.</p>

<h3>Creating a Sitemap:</h3>
<img src="/Portfolio/XImages/Drexel Portal Redsign/Sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap">
<p>With the data collected through the card sort exercise, I was able to create a sitemap for the redesign.</p>

<h3> Designing A Site Map</h3>
<p>I observed from all 3 of the participants that how they create different categories or main sections is dependent on their context and understanding of Drexel’s payment portal and the options that they or their parents use the most.  Every participant had reasoning on why they placed certain pages under the section which made sense and was justified by the context they know it from.</p>

  <p>  I found that U01 got a little confused over the placement of the Refunds page and put it in the Help Section. U02 put both the Refunds and the Deposits section under the Account Activity section, which he said was only there to serve as a live bank statement and nothing to do with the exchange of money. After the exercise, I found that Ryan and Xzavier placed the Refunds and Deposits in sections where they did not belong because U01 and U02 barely use those two things and were confused about what their function is. Hence they miscategorized these two pages.</p>

<p> U03 strongly categorized a lot of pages and most of them made a lot of sense to me. I could also see a little bias when they were arranging cards to make a standalone section for security and authorized users because they said that they had most problems with these two sections when they were using the portal with their dad. Making a different section for it would make it easier for them to go to it if they ever run into a problem with security or authorized users.</p>

<p>After learning everyone’s logic and reasoning I think everyone wants to prioritize things that are important and used the most. These sections should make the main categories and the rest should be summed under it.</p>

<h3>Stylesheets</h3>

<img src="/Portfolio/XImages/Drexel Portal Redsign/Stylesheet2.png" alt="sheet2">
<p>After conducting the interview, doing affinity mapping, and the card sort exercise I had enough data to understand what the users of the website wanted to do, what was causing them problems to do that, and what I could do in the redesign to solve these problems. With all the data and the idea for the new layout which I got through the card sort exercise. I started making the stylesheets to start wireframing</p>

<h3>Making Wireframes</h3>
<p>After deciding on color choices, typography and other stylistic choises. I started making wireframes for the website.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Color Choices: I finally chose to go with the Drexel Yellow, Blue( Using a Linear Radiant), white, and grey. I did this because I wanted Drexel’s payment portal to have a similar theme to other Drexel Websites. I did so only to maintain the consistency and brand of the Drexel University Websites.

    I think one thing my wireframe could do well was to solve the problem of navigation and the bad information hierarchy of the website. From the sitemap, I was able to understand how the users understood the portal and its use. I was able to use this information to categorize all information on the main menu on the left-hand side, and a secondary menu on the top. I also added clearly labeled sections for, ‘Settings’, ‘Logout’, and ‘Search’ as the people I interviewed talked about how they were often confused about how to get to these particular sections.
    
    I also wanted to add a personal element for the users of the website. For this, I added a place to hold a profile image, name, and student year.</p>
