    <h1>Curriculum Development with City Montessori School</h1>
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    
       
    

        <p> The method we came up with was the result of frustration of a few High school students
        who were bored with the method being used to teach English in high school classes. I and
        my friends have an avid interest in novels and books and reading everything we could lay
        our hands on, be it a newspaper, journal, research papers and even composition of our
        regular toothpaste, were absolutely furious when we saw the teaching method which
        provoked no interest in students towards this beautiful subject and was taught with no.
        more purpose than to procure marks in various examinations, hence disparaging it to an
        crucial extent. </p> 
        
        
    
        
      
        
       <h1> New Methodology to Learn English better in City Montessori Highschool, Lucknow, India</h1>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2>What started all this?</h2>
        
        <p> The method I with my team came up with was the result of the frustration of a few High school students, who were bored with the method being used to teach English in high school classes.
        The method used in classes was monotonous and dry and provided little space for creative thinking or developing an appreciation for the subject.</p>
        
        <h2> What was the Problem?</h2>
        
       <p> The problem was in the way English Literature was taught in class. The teacher would have Reading Lectures where they would read 10 pages of a book. While the pages are being read, the students are required to pay close attention so they note down important points in the plot or story. After the teacher is done with the lecture, they dictate 3-5 Reference-to-Context Questions which are from 10 pages of reading done before. A reference-to-context Question Looks as follows</p>
        
        
        <h2>The Problem: Small Details</h2>
        
        
       <p> As you can see each Reference to Context has multiple questions Inside it. Now get ready because this is where it starts to get boring!
            What makes it boring is that the 3-5 Questions which the teacher dictates, have to completed by the entire class. So a class of 60 students, all of them copy the same questions, and as expected, write similar answers because as you can see nearly all questions are factual, involving no involvement of the student in the story or in the themes discussed in the story. These 3-5 RTC(Reference to Context) take a good amount of time and involve very little learning as students are just asked to find answers from the book and write them in the class notebook. 
               The Class teacher is also required to check every studentâ€™s notebook. Please note that there are 60 students in a class and there are 4 sections that a teacher has to teach in. This means every week, if a teacher teaches 10 pages of a book, at the end of the week she is supposed to check 240 notebooks to makes sure the answers written by the students are proper. The tragedy of this situation for the teacher is that checking notebooks also needs checking them for spellings and every mistake in grammar they can find. This makes it an extremely tedious job for a teacher and on top of it is very monotonous because all questions are similar 
            On interviewing teachers I found that sometimes they spend 20 hours a week of their time checking notebooks for proper grammar, and answers which they absolutely hate but they also have to accept it because it is part of their job. What I saw was a waste of resources because a teacher instead of spending 20 hours checking notebooks for frivolous mistakes could use their creativity, knowledge, and experience in more engaging ways of learning. </p>
        
        
        <h2>Asking why are things the way they are?</h2>
        
        <p> I was frustrated by the methods used to teach English in school. I wanted to know why things were the way they were. I found that there were certain requirements that the school council wanted the English department to fulfill. 
        <ol>
       <li> Completion of exhaustive notes that help in the examination.</li>
       <li> Getting students ready for exams</li>
      <li>  Completion of coursework in Time</li>
    </ol>
   
        
       <p> I was a little shocked to see these 4 requirements because I was not sure if with the method we had we were able to accomplish any of these requirements. 
        
        Analyzing the Current Method on the Basis of Requirements set by the council. I did some research and talked to as many teachers as I could to gather all data about the current method used. I will comment on what is the status of each of these requirements and what are the effects on teachers and on students with the current method while fulfilling the requirement.</p>
        
        
        
        
       <h2> Completion of exhaustive notes that help in the examination.</h2>
        
       <p> Factual Status: Teachers and Students read 10 pages together in Reading Lectures. 3-5 Reference-To-Context Questions are given by the Teacher to students for homework.
        This, in turn, leads to 30-50 Questions from the entire book(100-120 Pages). A class usually takes 7-9 months to complete a 100-120 Page book, with 30 to 50 Questions in the notebook.</p>
        
       <h2> What English Teachers said about it:</h2>
        
      <p>  RTC Questions are important. Doing multiple RTC Questions helps students familiarize themselves with the exam pattern. Teachers usually spend 20-25 hours of the week checking notebooks for frivolous mistakes. </p>
        
       <h2> What Students said about it: </h2>
        
      <p>  The students do not think that the notebooks fulfill the requirement defined above. According to one multiple students, Notebooks take an enormous amount of time and effort to maintain. On the top of that a notebook only has 30-50 Questions from 100-120 Pages of the book. According to students the number of questions are not enough to cover a 100-120 page book and they ultimately have to use the book when preparing for exams. In a multiple section survey of 11th grade, I found only 10% of students actually use the notebooks to study for class.</p>
        
        
      <h2> Getting students ready for exams </h2> 
        
      <p>  Factual Status: This is where the methodology worked well. Both teachers and students agreed that Students are made familiar with the current exam pattern along with ample guidance on exam techniques such as particular usage of sentences, keywords and other rules as defined by the school council.</p>
        
      <h2>  Completion of coursework in Time </h2>
        
       <p> Factual Status: The method took 7-9 Months. Both Teachers and Students agreed that most of this time was spent in the creation, maintenance, and correction of notebooks by the students, and the teachers. Students were more frustrated because it takes a lot of work to maintain notebooks and in the end, the notebooks are not even comprehensive enough to prepare them for exams.</p>
        
        
        
        
      <h2>  Gathering All the data I jot down pain points and desirable values from the class. I recently realized it fits well in Value Prop Canvas </h2>
        
        <h3>Value Prop Teacher</h3>
        
        <h4> Pains Teacher</h4>
<ol>
      <li> Large numbers of notebooks to correct. (240 notebooks; roughly 3000 pages of correction work in a week).</li> 
       <li> Correction takes 20-25 Hours a week. </li>

    </ol>

     <h4>   Gains Teacher </h4>

<ol>
      <li>  Students learning well in class</li>
       <li> Students doing well in exams </li>

    </ol>  

       <h4> Jobs </h4>

<ol>  
    <li>   Make sure students make and do work in the notebooks. </li>   
    <li>    Check all notebooks for mistakes in spelling, grammar, structure. </li>
    <li>    Make sure all notebooks are ready for inspection by the council members. </li>
     <li>  Make sure the students follow the requirements of the school council. </li> 

    </ol>     
        
        
      <h3> What is Council Inspection? </h3> 
        
      <p>  I found the Council Inspection is a way to check if the teachers are doing their work diligently. How council members check this is visiting the school once every 6 months and checking our notebooks to see what kind of corrections and suggestions the teacher has made in the notebook. After the inspection, the teachers are graded and this report goes for their performance review. </p>
        
        
      <h3> Value Prop Students </h3> 
         
      <h4>  Pains Students </h4>
<ol>
     <li>   The readings usually get boring after the first few classes because they are only given questions to complete homework without any other involvement in class or learning.</li>
    <li>   The notebooks are frustrating to create and maintain and take a lot of effort in doing so.</li> 
    <li>   The students think their effort in making these notebooks is not fruitful because they barely use it in exams. </li> 

    </ol>  

       <h4> Gains Students: </h4>
<ol>
       <li> Fun and Involvement in class and learning. </li>
      <li>  Good Scores in class. </li>
    </ol>  


       <h4> Jobs: </h4>
<ol>
    <li>    Read the pages of the book. </li>
    <li>    Write answers for RTC questions discussed in class. </li>
     <li>   Learn the Examination Pattern well. </li>
    </ol>    
        
     <h3>  Defining the Problem: </h3> 
     
    <p> The problem was the Current methodology. The methodology is definitely monotonous and requires enormous amounts of time and effort from both students and teachers to maintain notebooks just for the sake of the inspection department. The notebooks in themselves are futile as they are not comprehensive enough to support students to prepare students for exams(Only 30-50 Questions from 100-120 Pages). These notebooks also take 20-25 Hours a week for the teachers which is a large waste of human resources our school has. </p>
        
      <h4>  Constraints: The Inspection Department Requirements for English Literature</h4> 

      <ol>
    <li>   The teacher needs to make students maintain a notebook with at least 30 Questions with the current exam pattern</li> 
     <li>   The teacher needs to complete exhaustive notes that help in the examination.</li>
     <li>   Make sure the students are ready for exams</li>
     <li>  The teacher needs to make sure the coursework is completed in the given time(7-9 months) </li> 

    </ol>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Animation is everything
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
       <h3> Working on a Solution: </h3>
        
      <p> Before working on a solution, I collaborated with a team of teachers, students and in charge to make a list of features  they would like to have in the new methodology: 
        
        Though the discussion was long, everyone agreed that the new methodology should provide students with a Complete Learning Experience: </p> 
        
      <h4> Complete Learning Experience promotes:  </h4> 
      <ol>
    <li>  Independent research outside textbooks </li> 
     <li>   Taking charge of oneâ€™s own learning </li>
     <li>   Self-study and original thinking </li>
     <li>   Application of things learned in the classroom.  </li>
    </ol>  
      
    
    
      <h3> Guiding Design Statement: </h3>
      
     <p> The new methodology should be designed in such a way that it fits the Constraints defined by the Inspection Department and also promote a Complete Learning Experience. This new method should also utilize the time effort of students and teachers in an efficient way.
      The Solution was a long process and came through in a brainstorming session after weeks of research which will be probably too long for this already long page. But here are the solution I came up with. This methodology is arranged Chronologically
        
        <ol>
      <li>  Replacing notebooks with a more analytical/comprehensive resource â€“ Question Banks. - Group A </li>
   <li>    Assignments are given to students not involved in the preparation of Question banks. - Group B </li> 
    
        
        
      <li> Collection of Question Bank. </li>
     <li>   Activity-Based Sessions. </li>
     <li>   Sharing/Distribution of question banks. </li>

    </ol>
    

   
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
      <h3>  Methodology: </h3>
        
       <h4> Step 1: </h4>
       
   <p> The teacher reads 10 pages of the book. After reading these pages, the teacher selects 10 students and assigns one page to one student. The homework of the student is to read the page assigned to them thoroughly and make 3-5 Reference-To-Context Questions from each page and write the best answer they can for the questions. This is how every student will constitute 3-5 RTC questions and with 10 students doing the same thing, this will contribute to 30-50 Questions from 10 pages of the book. The accumulation of questions will be called Question Banks and the group of students assigned for the week to make questions will be called Group A. 
        Note: Different students are selected in Group A after the different reading sessions. Each student needs to participate at least twice.
     </p>
        
     <h4>   Step 2:</h4> 
     
   <p> While Group A is busy doing Question banks, the other group, Group B (rest of the students in the class) will be asked to read the same pages. Their homework would be to do either an individual or group presentation of the pages they read. It could be a skit, play, song, poem, or anything that they think would help to explain to the rest of the class what they learned. The purpose of the presentation will be to explain the  topic to their classmates as easily as possible. These presentations would show how much
        understanding of the chapter was achieved by the group and how clearly they present
        before their classmates and teacher.  </p>
        
      <h4> Step 3:  </h4> 
      
      
     <p> This is the place where the most important aspects of this new methodology show up. As we saw before in the old methodology. A lot of work was done by the teacher and how learning had a very teacher-centric approach.(The teacher made all questions and decided all activities). The teacher receives the question banks and checks them for mistakes. These question banks are then graded and the revised version is distributed in the class. Group B is also graded on how good their presentation is. 

    </p>
        
        
     <h4>   Step 4: </h4>
     
   
     <p>  Different Activity Based Sessions are conducted. Some examples are as follows. </p>
     <ol><li>  Debates( b/w different characters) </li> 
    <li>    Use of Drama â€“ A powerful tool to enhance learning experience. </li>
    <li>    Expression through an Art form â€“ Sketches/Paintings/Short stories. </li>
   <li>    â€˜Entrance/Exit Ticketsâ€™  </li> 
   <li>     Other Activities suggested by Teachers/Students that enhance learning. </li>
    </ol>
    
        
        
      <h3>  Additional Details on Each Component: </h3>
        
       Preparation of Question Banks (Group A) 
       <ol>
    <li>   Selection of students â€“ 10 students/10 pages
        (Selected by Teacher/Volunteer)</li> 
  <li>    Number of questions per page â€“ 5 to 7.
            ( 550 to 770 questions from book) </li>  
          </ol>

      Type of questions(On Current Exam Pattern) 
      <ol>
    <li>    Factual questions. </li>
     <li>Analytical Questions </li>   

    <li>    Concept Based questions that encourage practical application of textbook themes. </li>
     <li>   Question Banks would be checked by the teacher. </li>
    <li>    Questions from the question banks will be asked in the class for which marks will be awarded. </li>
     <li>   These marks can be used as an additional test. </li>
       <li> After the activity, corrected question banks will be distributed in the class. </li>
      </ol>
      Assignments given to other students(Group B)
      <ol>
      
    <li>    Rhetorical questions that spark love of learning: given by the teacher. </li>
      <li>  Activities that encourage self study and active participation in the class. </li>
     <li>   Activities that enhance communication skills. </li>
    <li>    Activities that provide a local stage to students to portray other skills while learning. </li>
      <li>  Fun and Learn activities. </li>
        
    </ol>



       <h3> Evaluating Efficiency </h3>

       <ol>
     <li>   Time taken: 15 pages a week. </li>
     <li>  110 pages in 6 to 8 weeks or 1.5 to 2 months. </li> 
      <li>  Questions done in question banks- 5 to 7 per page </li>
     <li>   550-770 questions from the book </li>
      <li>  Question Banks helping in increased amount of self-study </li>
      <li>  Add-on: A plethora of activities to Enhance Learning </li>
    </ol>
      
    
<p>From the perceptions of the subject teacher and the reactions acquired of the students, it
        can be expressed that this system of learning was compelling, agreeable and intriguing for
        students. The inclusion of the ideas of group presentation and exclusion paperwork which
        the students usually found boring caused the rise of interest among the students. Their
        success ranged between 85 percent to 100 for percent. It helped the students collaborate,
        oblige and participate in a better way. The interest in knowledge group, oral presentation
        and arrangement built up a feeling of association what's more, certainty among the
        students, particularly among the low achievers and loners. Earlier knowledge of the criteria
        for appraisal cleared up individual undertakings and centers the endeavors.
        Notwithstanding the undercurrent of rivalry among the groups, there were cases of
        collaboration over the groups and a nonattendance of undesirable rivalry. The method
        highlights a reward for the efforts, the skills of self-study and investigation and presentation,
        and discourages rote learning  
    </p> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
          
      <h3>  Benefits </h3>

     <ol>  
      
  <li> Participation of teachers and students becomes equal. </li>  
 <li>      Better use of teacherâ€™s creativity  </li> 
   <li>    Enhancement of creativity and original thinking in students </li>
