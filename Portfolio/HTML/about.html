               <p>Hi there! I am Tushar and and I am an Interactive Digital Media student at Drexel University. I am deeply curious about how art, technology and psychology blend in together to create beautiful and brilliant products which solve human problems around the world. What even excites me more is the unending potential of technology and how it can impact and affect our lives so profoundly. As a designer I want to be someone who can apply his passion for people and wants to use design, technology, and art to create systems or products that bring joy to people when used. I am always willing to learn new things and always look for different sources/people I can learn from.
